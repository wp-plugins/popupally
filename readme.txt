== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many popups can I have? =
You can configure 2 popups without upgrading to the Pro version

= Can I setup the popup for every post and page on my site? =
Absolutely! You can enable the popup for every post and page with 1 click on the display settings!

= Do I need to know how to modify HTML/CSS code? =
No programming experience required! You can see all the customizations instantly in the Visual Editor.

= How do I put in my own sign up form? =
You just need to copy-and-paste in the HTML code from your CRM/list platform, and we will do the rest! No need to get your hands dirty with code.

= The popup was working, but it is not longer showing up even though I did not change anything! =
This is most likely due to the "Show popup every [x] days" option in Display Settings. Normally, you do not want to popup to show up every time a visitor comes to your website, so this option will stop the popup from showing up for [x] number of days. However, this makes testing difficult. The good news is that there are many ways to get around it. Please see the [tutorial](http://ambitionally.com/popupally/tutorials/#testing-private) for more details!

= I have done everything according to the tutorial, but the popup is not showing up! =
There are 3 main causes for this:
* With "Show for all pages?" checked in Display Settings, please make sure you do NOT check "All Pages" and "All Posts" under "Except for these posts/pages"
* Javascript errors will prevent popups from showing. With the page loaded, you can open the Developer View in Chrome and look for the red error sign. The error is usually caused by another plugin, so you can disable the active plugins one-by-one to see if that helps.
* It could be a theme issue. The [Advanced Settings](http://ambitionally.com/popupally/tutorials/#testing-theme) might help. If not, please contact your developer and make sure your theme implements the standard WordPress hooks (wp_head and wp_footer)

= Where do the sign-ups go? =
You need an email marketing system before you can use PopupAlly. PopupAlly helps you create sign up forms that collects names and emails, which you can then send newsletter to on a regular basis. PopupAlly does not send email directly to the subscribers.
You can check out the systems we recommend in the Email Marketing section on our [Resource Page](http://nathalielussier.com/online-business-resources)
Once you have picked an email marketing system, you can integrate it with PopupAlly in the Style Settings. Please take a look at the [tutorial](http://ambitionally.com/popupally/tutorials/#configure-style-integration) for more in-depth explanations
